## 7. Algorithm Analysis Techniques

### 1. Time Complexity
- Time complexity describes how the runtime of an algorithm increases with the size of the input.
- Helps evaluate the efficiency of algorithms.
- Common complexities:
  - **O(1)** – Constant time
  - **O(log n)** – Logarithmic time
  - **O(n)** – Linear time
  - **O(n log n)** – Linearithmic time
  - **O(n²)** – Quadratic time
  - **O(2ⁿ), O(n!)** – Exponential time

### 2. Asymptotic Notation
- Used to describe the upper, lower, or tight bound behavior of an algorithm:
  - **Big O (O)** – Worst-case upper bound  
    Example: O(n²) means the runtime grows at most as n².
  - **Big Omega (Ω)** – Best-case lower bound  
    Example: Ω(n) means the algorithm takes at least linear time.
  - **Big Theta (Θ)** – Tight bound (both upper and lower)  
    Example: Θ(n log n) means the runtime grows exactly at that rate.

### 3. Substitution Method
- A method to solve recurrence relations by guessing the form of the solution and proving it using mathematical induction.
- **Example:**
  - T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n  
  - Guess: T(n) = O(n log n)  
  - Prove the guess using induction.

### 4. Iteration Method
- Solves recurrence relations by expanding them step by step until a pattern is observed.
- **Example:**
  - T(n) = T(n/2) + n  
  - T(n/2) = T(n/4) + n/2  
  - …
  - Total = n + n/2 + n/4 + … = O(n)

### 5. Master Theorem
- Provides a direct way to analyze the time complexity of divide-and-conquer algorithms.
- Applies to recurrences of the form:  
  **T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n)**  
- **Cases:**
  1. If f(n) = O(n^log_b(a - ε)) → T(n) = Θ(n^log_b(a))
  2. If f(n) = Θ(n^log_b(a)) → T(n) = Θ(n^log_b(a) * log n)
  3. If f(n) = Ω(n^log_b(a + ε)) and regularity condition holds → T(n) = Θ(f(n))
- **Example:**
  - Merge Sort: T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n → Case 2 → Θ(n log n)


  ## 8. Tree, Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree

### 1. Tree
- A **tree** is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes.
- The top node is called the **root**; nodes without children are called **leaves**.
- Each node (except the root) has exactly one parent.
- Trees are used in many applications like file systems, databases, and parsing expressions.
- **Terminology:**
  - **Parent, Child, Sibling**
  - **Subtree**: A tree formed by a node and its descendants.
  - **Depth**: Number of edges from root to node.
  - **Height**: Number of edges on the longest path from node to a leaf.

### 2. Binary Tree
- A **binary tree** is a tree where each node has at most two children: **left** and **right**.
- Types of binary trees:
  - **Full Binary Tree**: Every node has 0 or 2 children.
  - **Complete Binary Tree**: All levels are filled except possibly the last, which is filled from left to right.
  - **Perfect Binary Tree**: All internal nodes have two children and all leaves are at the same level.
- Common traversals:
  - **Inorder (Left, Root, Right)**
  - **Preorder (Root, Left, Right)**
  - **Postorder (Left, Right, Root)**
  - **Level-order (Breadth-First Search)**

### 3. Binary Search Tree (BST)
- A **Binary Search Tree** is a binary tree with the property:
  - For any node `n`:  
    - All values in the left subtree < `n.value`  
    - All values in the right subtree > `n.value`
- Operations:
  - **Search**: O(h) time complexity (h = tree height)
  - **Insert**: O(h)
  - **Delete**: O(h)
- Best case: **Balanced BST** → O(log n)  
- Worst case: **Unbalanced BST** (like a linked list) → O(n)
- BSTs are used in:
  - Dynamic sets
  - Searching and sorting
  - Dictionary implementations


## 9. Heap, Binary Heap, Min Heap, Max Heap

### 1. Heap
- A **heap** is a special **tree-based** data structure that satisfies the **heap property**.
- It is usually implemented as a **complete binary tree**.
- **Heap property**:
  - In a **Max Heap**: Parent node ≥ Children
  - In a **Min Heap**: Parent node ≤ Children
- Common uses:
  - **Priority queues**
  - **Heap Sort**
  - **Task scheduling**

### 2. Binary Heap
- A **binary heap** is a **complete binary tree** that satisfies the **heap property**.
- Typically implemented using an **array**:
  - For a node at index `i`:
    - Left child → `2i + 1`
    - Right child → `2i + 2`
    - Parent → `(i - 1) / 2`

### 3. Min Heap
- A **Min Heap** is a binary heap where:
  - The **root** contains the **smallest** element.
  - Each parent node ≤ its children.
- Operations:
  - **Insert**: O(log n)
  - **Extract-Min**: O(log n)
  - **Peek-Min**: O(1)
- Applications:
  - **Dijkstra’s algorithm**
  - **Minimum spanning tree (Prim’s algorithm)**
  - **Event simulation**

### 4. Max Heap
- A **Max Heap** is a binary heap where:
  - The **root** contains the **largest** element.
  - Each parent node ≥ its children.
- Operations:
  - **Insert**: O(log n)
  - **Extract-Max**: O(log n)
  - **Peek-Max**: O(1)
- Applications:
  - **Heap Sort**
  - **Priority queues**
  - **Finding the k largest elements**

## 9. Disjoint Set (Union-Find)

### 1. Disjoint Set
- A **Disjoint Set** (also known as **Union-Find**) is a data structure that keeps track of a partition of elements into **disjoint (non-overlapping) subsets**.
- It provides efficient support for the following operations:
  - **MakeSet(x)**: Creates a set containing a single element `x`.
  - **FindSet(x)**: Returns the representative (or "leader") of the set that contains `x`.
  - **Union(x, y)**: Merges the sets containing elements `x` and `y`.

### 2. Disjoint Set Representation
- Internally, each set is represented as a **tree**, with each node pointing to its **parent**.
- The **representative** of a set is the **root** of its tree.
- Optimizations:
  - **Path Compression**: Flattens the structure of the tree whenever `FindSet` is called, speeding up future queries.
  - **Union by Rank / Size**: Always attach the smaller tree to the root of the larger one to keep trees shallow.

### 3. Operations and Complexity

| Operation      | Description                                | Time Complexity |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| `MakeSet(x)`   | Initializes a new set with element `x`     | O(1)            |
| `FindSet(x)`   | Returns the root of the set containing `x` | O(α(n))         |
| `Union(x, y)`  | Merges the sets containing `x` and `y`     | O(α(n))         |

> 🔹 Here, `α(n)` is the **inverse Ackermann function**, which grows extremely slowly. For all practical values of `n`, it is ≤ 5.
